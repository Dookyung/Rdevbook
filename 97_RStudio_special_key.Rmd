Let's try using `seq()` which makes regular **seq**uences of numbers and, while we're at it, learn more helpful features of RStudio. Type `se` and hit TAB. A popup shows you possible completions. Specify `seq()` by typing more (a "q") to disambiguate, or by using ↑/↓ arrows to select. Notice the floating tooltip that pops up, reminding you of the function's arguments and purpose. If you want more help, press F1 to get all the details in the help tab in the lower right pane.
